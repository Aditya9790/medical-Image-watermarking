# Medical-Watermarking

Medical watermarking using advanced morphological processing techniques like : 
- Image Dilation
- Erosion
- Advanced image processing techniques like Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT).

Along with it I have implemented **image encryption using Chaotic mapping and Logistic mapping**.

Along with successful embedding of the watermark the robustness of the watermark for several attacks like **Gaussian noise attack** and **Salt and pepper attack** is also shown.
